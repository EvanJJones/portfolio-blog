I am a Full-Stack Developer currently working at a small startup in Boston. I have made all sorts of things but my favorites are the things people get to directly interact with. I want to do my best to make websites look and feel great to everyone. 

You might have noticed the bar on the bottom of the site. You can use that to transition to older versions of this site. My goal with this portfolio was to have a transparent view of how this site has changed over time. Expect things to break if you go back in time, that's part of the fun.

is this working?
