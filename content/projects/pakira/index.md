This is an ongoing project at the time of writing this (3/16/21). The first company I have worked for since finishing bootcamp. It is an entire web platform for commodities trading, including a directory, chat and forum. 

I have worked on a bunch of different pieces for over a year now. I built the majority of the Admin application in React for administrators to control users, companies, and data. I built the backbones of the chat system which uses socket.io and Mongodb for instant user to user chat. I customized and helped deploy the discourse forum and built a custom plugin for displaying information in the sidebar.
