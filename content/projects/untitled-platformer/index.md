This was mostly a proof of concept I made in Unity. It is a very simple Metroidvania style game where you pick up power-ups to let you do more and more and explore more of the map. I did everything myself including the art, and sound effects. It's really rough but it was the first "Complete" game I ever made. I think it has a few clever ideas and surprises despite how simple and messy it is overall.
