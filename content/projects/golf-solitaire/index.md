This is a solitaire game, based on the rules of golf solitaire. I made this by myself just to try and make a game for fun, and also to try out Gatsby. I designed all the cards myself using Figma, I'm pretty happy with the look of the game overall. I had a great time making this, despite the simplicity I think it's really fun.
