Recipe search site where you can sort by diet and intolerances, login and save recipes to a favorites page and then tag and sort them. This was built by a group of four people as the final project for our coding bootcamp. The front end is built in React without any CSS frameworks and the back end is node.js with MongoDB. 

I learned a lot from this project, but was ultimately pretty disappointed in how it turned out. My favorite piece of this project was the saved recipe page where you can filter and display your recipes in different ways. That was one of the first times I got to play around with react and make something that was responsive to the user.
