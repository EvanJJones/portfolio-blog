This was a game I made while working as an Administrative Coordinator at Boston University. I was paid mostly to sit there all day and had a lot of time to try and get other things done. I did it on my work computer and couldn't install any software, so it was built entirely using web based tools. Mostly done in Construct 3 using their visual coding language, all the art was done on a web based pixel editor, there is no sound since I wasn't able to wear headphones while working.

I worked very hard on this for a few weeks, I eventually lost interest and the latter half of the game is much thinner than the beginning. I am very proud I was able to put this together, it is the most complete game I have made and I think it has some pretty interesting stuff in it. It's very buggy since I stopped working on it, but that just adds to the charm.
