description: A starter post so there is something on the blog

This will one day be where my blog lives, if I decide doing a blog here is something I want to do. It made sense to me to put a spot here for me to be able to publish my ideas or thoughts on different things. But I don't know when if ever that will be a priority for me. I have never felt much urge to post things online, but maybe I will want to change that one day. A part of me wants to change it today. 

But for now, this little piece of writing will hold the place of a real blog, it probably won't leave even if the real blog becomes a thing. 

Thanks for reading!
